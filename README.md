A pop up window will then prompt you to enter the length of the password, followed by some confirmation prompt for whether to include special, numeric, lowercase or uppercase characters. 

Note that an invalid input, or not including any of the 4 types of characters will give an alert and exit the process. But you may start over as you wish by clicking on the red button again. 

The generated password will appear in the dotted container on the html page. The password should contain at least one character of each charater type that the user confirmed to include.
